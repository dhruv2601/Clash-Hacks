Our app helps you convey your message via song related GIF's and audio, extracted using a sophisticated NLP method of semantic text similarity between target text and song lyrics. Next it extracts the song's video from youtube according to artist and converts it into a small GIF file with the corresponding lyric text.
The video timeframe is selected via the caption TTML provided by the youtube API, and the actual length is trimmed to look for only the target lyric text. In the end we are left with 3 GIF's for each text string used by the user. The final interface is planned to have to a chat head based app, wherein whenever you click on it, generated GIFS are shown.
